# üéÑ Advent Of Code

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in almost anything (be it a programming language, Excel or even Minecraft). Participants are presented with a puzzle each day of December up to and including Christmas Day (December 25th).

This repository contains my solutions to the problems I've solved from Advent of Code, both during the event and outside of it.
